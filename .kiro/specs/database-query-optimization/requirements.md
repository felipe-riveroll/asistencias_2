# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current attendance report generation script (`generar_reporte_avanzado.py`) has significant performance issues due to inefficient database querying patterns. The script currently makes individual database calls for each employee-day combination, resulting in hundreds or thousands of separate queries. This creates a major bottleneck that makes the script very slow to execute. The goal is to optimize the database access pattern to reduce query count and improve overall performance while maintaining the same functionality and accuracy.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the attendance report generation to complete in a reasonable time, so that I can generate reports efficiently without long waiting periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the script processes attendance data THEN the total database query count SHALL be reduced by at least 90% compared to the current implementation
2. WHEN generating a report for 15 days with 50 employees THEN the script SHALL complete in under 30 seconds
3. WHEN the optimization is implemented THEN the script SHALL maintain the same output format and accuracy as the original version

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement batch database queries instead of individual queries, so that database round-trips are minimized and performance is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying employee schedules THEN the system SHALL fetch all required schedule data in a single or minimal number of database queries
2. WHEN processing multiple employees THEN the system SHALL use batch operations instead of row-by-row processing
3. WHEN the database connection is established THEN it SHALL be reused efficiently throughout the entire process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement data caching strategies, so that repeated database lookups are eliminated and processing speed is increased.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN employee schedule data is retrieved THEN it SHALL be cached in memory for reuse across multiple date calculations
2. WHEN the same employee-schedule combination is needed multiple times THEN the system SHALL use cached data instead of querying the database again
3. WHEN processing date ranges THEN schedule rules SHALL be pre-calculated and cached for efficient lookup

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the optimized script to handle errors gracefully, so that database connection issues don't cause complete failures and partial results can still be processed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN database connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and graceful degradation
2. WHEN batch queries encounter errors THEN the system SHALL attempt to process available data and report which employees couldn't be processed
3. WHEN optimization techniques are applied THEN the system SHALL maintain proper error handling and logging capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the code to be maintainable and well-structured, so that future modifications and debugging are straightforward.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the optimization is implemented THEN the code SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns between data fetching and processing
2. WHEN new database optimization techniques are added THEN they SHALL be implemented as separate, testable functions
3. WHEN the optimized code is reviewed THEN it SHALL include proper documentation explaining the optimization strategies used
